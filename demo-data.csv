soup,Basic + Awesome Broccoli Cheese Soup,https://pinchofyum.com/broccoli-cheese-soup,https://res.cloudinary.com/drqbsl9kv/image/upload/v1760998586/Broccoli-Cheese-Soup-1-2_izphys.jpg,"5 tablespoons butter, divided ;  1 small onion, minced ;  3 cloves garlic, minced ;  1 cup broccoli stems, chopped (optional) ;  1/4 cup all-purpose flour ;  1 cup whole milk ;  1 cup half and half ;  2 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable broth ;  2–3 cups broccoli florets, chopped into very small pieces ;  1 large carrot, thinly sliced ;  1 teaspoon salt (more or less to taste) ;  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ;  1/2 teaspoon paprika ;  an 8-ounce block of good quality extra-sharp cheddar cheese, grated","Sauté garlic and onion: In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and broccoli stems; sauté until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. ;  Build your roux: Add remaining 4 tablespoons butter to the soup pot. When butter is melted, add flour to the pot. Cook over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes, until flour is thickened. Slowly pour in the milk and half and half, whisking constantly. (It will start thick but eventually it will thin out and resemble a creamy soup base.) Continue to thin it out, gradually whisking in the broth. Simmer for 10 minutes or so, whisking occasionally to reincorporate the skin that may form. ;  Add broccoli: When the soup base is thickened nicely, stir in the broccoli, carrots, and spices. Simmer for 10 minutes or so, until the broccoli bits are bright green and fork-tender. ;  Add cheese: Transfer the pot off of heat and allow to cool slightly for a few minutes. Stir in most of the cheese until melted. Serve in bowls with a little extra cheese + a hunk of crusty bread for dunking – and yes, it’s okay to cry tears of cozy joy! This is a happy moment!",
soup,Basic + Awesome Creamy Potato Soup,https://pinchofyum.com/creamy-potato-soup,https://res.cloudinary.com/drqbsl9kv/image/upload/v1760999033/Creamy-Potato-Soup-3_rscd0u.jpg,"6 slices bacon ;  4 tablespoons butter ;  2 cups mirepoix (celery, carrots, and onions, all minced) ;  3 cloves garlic, minced ;  1/2 teaspoon salt ;  1/2 teaspoon of favorite seasoning (I’d recommend chicken seasoning mix which has thyme, rosemary, oregano, etc. – if it has salt, reduce the salt above) ;  1/4 cup all purpose flour ;  3 cups whole milk ;  1–2 cups chicken broth ;  2 russet potatoes, peeled and cubed","Bacon Prep: Bake the bacon on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Crumble or cut into pieces. ;  Soup Base: Melt the butter in a soup pot. Add the mirepoix, garlic, salt, and seasoning and sauté until nice and soft. Add flour and stir with the vegetables for a few minutes to cook off any floury taste. Add milk, just a little bit at a time, stirring after each addition until smooth and creamy. The soup should start out very thick and eventually thin out as you add milk. Add the potatoes, and add chicken broth as needed to achieve the right consistency. For a thicker soup, you may not need as much of the broth. ;  Simmer Time: Let the soup simmer for 30-40 minutes. The potato soup will thicken as it simmers, and even more as it cools down. I like to wait until the potatoes are almost melty, with their edges softened just a bit, before removing from heat. When ready to serve, crumble the bacon and stir it into the soup.",

Half the time I just end up eating these noodles over the stove in all their slippery, spicy goodness. But if you can manage, get the smashed broccoli and soft egg served up on top of a bowl of noodles, with an extra dollop of chili crisp over the eggs, and that is one beautiful meal.",

Air fry at 400 degrees for 8 minutes! ;  You’re Done! Yum! At this point it should be textured and golden on the outside, and juicy and delicious on the inside.
